        download the sample code
        <a herf="https://parshwa282011.github.io/drive/sample.zip">https://parshwa282011.github.io/drive/sample.zip</a>
        if you dont want to build of sample code then do the steps below
        <a>
            first:

            in your build dependencies before dependencies put
            def f = file('drive.aar')
            if (!f.exists()) {
                new URL('https://parshwa282011.github.io/drive/drive.aar').withInputStream{ i -> f.withOutputStream{ it << i }}
            }
            to download and save the file then in dependencies at the bottom put
            implementation files('drive.aar')
            then sync gradle
            this will setup the library
        </a>
        <a>
            Second in you code just import the library com.parshwa.drive.Drive;
            and make a instance of it like Drive driver = new Drive();
            and in init put driver.init();
            you can use driver.change(value);
            before the init to change values so it works.
